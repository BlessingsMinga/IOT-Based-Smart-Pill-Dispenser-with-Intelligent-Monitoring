# IOT-Based-Smart-Pill-Dispenser-with-Intelligent-Monitoring
As part of our schoolâ€™s Real time embedded systems course, our team of 11 members is designing an IoT-powered Smart Pill Dispenser to explore real-world applications of embedded systems, AI, and healthcare technology. This project combines classroom learning with hands-on innovation to solve a critical problem of medication non-adherence.
How It Works:

Our smart dispenser automates and monitors medication schedules using:
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Biometric Security â€“ Facial recognition/fingerprint scanning to prevent misuse.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Alerts â€“ Mobile app notifications for missed doses, low stock, or errors.<br>
ðŸ”¹ RFID Medicine Verification â€“ Ensures the correct pills are loaded.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Voice Reminders â€“ Makes the system accessible for elderly or visually impaired users.<br>
ðŸ”¹ Overdose Protection â€“ Blocks incorrect doses and alerts caregivers.<br>

<br>
Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, weâ€™re gaining practical experience in: <br>

Collaborative Engineering â€“ Dividing tasks (hardware, software, testing) among team members.<br>

Problem-Solving â€“ Troubleshooting real-world IoT and AI challenges.<br>

User-Centered Design â€“ Conducting research to address patient/caregiver needs.<br>

Presentation Skills â€“ Documenting progress and presenting findings to peers/teachers. <br><br>

Why It Matters:

Medication errors cause thousands of preventable hospitalizations yearly. By building this prototype, we aim to:<br>
âœ… Improve patient safety â€“ Reducing human error in home medication management.<br>
âœ… Apply STEM concepts â€“ Bridging theory (coding, circuits, AI) with practical solutions.<br>
âœ… Inspire future projects â€“ Encouraging peers to tackle healthcare tech challenges.<br>
