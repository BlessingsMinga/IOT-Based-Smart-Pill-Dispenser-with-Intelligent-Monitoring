# IOT-Based-Smart-Pill-Dispenser-with-Intelligent-Monitoring
As part of our schoolâ€™s Real time embedded systems course, our team of 11 members is designing an IoT-powered Smart Pill Dispenser to explore real-world applications of embedded systems, AI, and healthcare technology. This project combines classroom learning with hands-on innovation to solve a critical problem of medication non-adherence.
How It Works:

Our smart dispenser automates and monitors medication schedules using:
ðŸ”¹ Biometric Security â€“ Facial recognition/fingerprint scanning to prevent misuse.
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Alerts â€“ Mobile app notifications for missed doses, low stock, or errors.
ðŸ”¹ RFID Medicine Verification â€“ Ensures the correct pills are loaded.
ðŸ”¹ Voice Reminders â€“ Makes the system accessible for elderly or visually impaired users.
ðŸ”¹ Overdose Protection â€“ Blocks incorrect doses and alerts caregivers.
Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, weâ€™re gaining practical experience in:

    Collaborative Engineering â€“ Dividing tasks (hardware, software, testing) among team members.

    Problem-Solving â€“ Troubleshooting real-world IoT and AI challenges.

    User-Centered Design â€“ Conducting research to address patient/caregiver needs.

    Presentation Skills â€“ Documenting progress and presenting findings to peers/teachers.

#Why It Matters:

Medication errors cause thousands of preventable hospitalizations yearly. By building this prototype, we aim to:
âœ… Improve patient safety â€“ Reducing human error in home medication management.
âœ… Apply STEM concepts â€“ Bridging theory (coding, circuits, AI) with practical solutions.
âœ… Inspire future projects â€“ Encouraging peers to tackle healthcare tech challenges.

Next Steps:
Weâ€™re currently in the [prototyping/testing] phase and welcome feedback from teachers and classmates!
Key School-Centric Adjustments:

    Academic framing â€“ Links to coursework, skills gained, and teacher/peer involvement.

    Team size/roles â€“ Highlights student collaboration (adjust "[X students]" as needed).

    Simplified tech terms â€“ Keeps tech details clear without sounding overly technical.

    Progress tracking â€“ Mentions the current phase to show itâ€™s an active learning process.
