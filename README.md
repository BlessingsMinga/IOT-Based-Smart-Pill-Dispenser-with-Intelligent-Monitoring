# IOT-Based-Smart-Pill-Dispenser-with-Intelligent-Monitoring
As part of our schoolâ€™s Real time embedded systems course, our team of 11 members is designing an IoT-powered Smart Pill Dispenser to explore real-world applications of embedded systems, AI, and healthcare technology. This project combines classroom learning with hands-on innovation to solve a critical problem of medication non-adherence.
